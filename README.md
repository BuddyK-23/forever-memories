# üèóÔ∏è Forever Memories (LUKSO dApp)

"Forever Memories" dApp focus on creating a dApp on the LUKSO blockchain that allows users to upload photos, encrypt them client-side, store them on IPFS, and manage them through categorised vaults (LSP-9). Each photo, along with its metadata, will be represented as an LSP-8 token, which will be stored in a relevant vault based on its category.

## Features

- User Photo Upload Interface
  ‚òõ A user-friendly interface that allows users to either take a photo using their device‚Äôs camera or upload a photo from their file system.
  ‚òõ This interface should be built using React for a seamless integration with the LUKSO blockchain and IPFS.
- Client-Side Encryption
  ‚òõ Implement encryption of the photo file directly on the user's device before it is uploaded to IPFS to ensure privacy and security.
  ‚òõ Use a strong encryption standard, ensuring that the encryption keys are managed securely and ideally are unique to the user or session.
- IPFS Integration for Storage
  ‚òõ After encryption, the photo will be uploaded to IPFS, and the IPFS hash of the encrypted file will be stored.
  ‚òõ The IPFS hash is critical as it will be used within the blockchain for referencing the photo in a decentralised manner.
- Vault Management (LSP-9)
  ‚òõ Develop smart contracts that allow users to create and manage different vaults for categorising their photos.
  ‚òõ Each vault can represent a different category (e.g., vacations, family, friends) and will contain multiple LSP-8 tokens, each corresponding to an individual photo or memory.
- Minting LSP-8 Tokens
  ‚òõ For each photo uploaded, an LSP-8 token will be minted. This token will represent the "memory," which includes the encrypted photo and metadata such as title, description, and the vault category it belongs to.
  ‚òõ The minting process will include assigning the photo's IPFS hash as part of the token's metadata to ensure that the photo can be identified and retrieved securely from IPFS.
